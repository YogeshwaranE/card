        Two hearts, one love, a lifetime to share,
        <br>
        Yogii and Hema, a beautiful pair.
        <br>
        Through laughter and tears, come what may,
        <br>
        Theyâ€™ll walk hand in hand, every step of the way.
        <br>
        From this day forward, a new chapter unfolds,
        <br>
        With dreams to chase and hands to hold.
        <br>
        Together they'll grow, side by side,
        <br>
        With love as their anchor and hope as their guide.
        <br>
        So let us gather, family and friends,
        <br>
        To celebrate love that never ends.
        <br>
        For Yogeshwaran and Hemalatha, today is the start,
        <br>
        Of a lifetime of love, and one united heart.</div>
